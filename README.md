## Spotify Developer Setup

1. Go to the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)

2. Log in with your Spotify account (create one if needed)

3. Click "Create App"
   - App name: Choose a name (e.g., "Nocturne")
   - App description: Brief description of your app
   - Redirect URI: Add `https://nocturne.brandons.place` for non-development usage, or `https://your.local.ip.address:port` for development usage
   - Select "Web API" and "Web Playback SDK" as the API's you will be using

4. After creating the app, you'll see your:
   - Client ID (shown on the dashboard)
   - Client Secret (click "Show Client Secret")

5. Required Scopes:
   The app needs these Spotify scopes:
   ```
   user-read-recently-played
   user-read-private
   user-top-read
   user-read-playback-state
   user-modify-playback-state
   user-read-currently-playing
   user-library-read
   user-library-modify
   playlist-read-private
   playlist-read-collaborative
   playlist-modify-public
   playlist-modify-private
   ```

## Local Development Server

First, set up the configuration and database:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nocturne-ui.git
cd nocturne
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
bun install
```

3. Copy the environment example file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

4. Set up your Supabase project:
   - Create a new project at [Supabase](https://supabase.com)
   - Create a new table named `spotify_credentials` with the following schema:

```sql
create table spotify_credentials (
  id uuid default uuid_generate_v4() primary key,
  temp_id text not null,
  client_id text not null,
  encrypted_client_secret text not null,
  refresh_token text,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,
  expires_at timestamp with time zone,
  last_used timestamp with time zone,
  first_used_at timestamp with time zone,
  token_refresh_count integer default 0,
  user_agent text
);

-- Add policies for Row Level Security (RLS)
alter table spotify_credentials enable row level security;

-- Cleanup expired records
create policy "Cleanup expired records"
on spotify_credentials for all
using (expires_at < current_timestamp or refresh_token = current_setting('app.current_refresh_token'::text, true));

-- Cleanup unused temp IDs
create policy "cleanup_unused_temp_ids"
on spotify_credentials for all
using (created_at < current_timestamp - interval '1 hour' and refresh_token is null);

-- Enforce expiration
create policy "Enforce expiration"
on spotify_credentials for all
using (expires_at is null or expires_at > current_timestamp);

-- Update restrictions
create policy "Restricted updates"
on spotify_credentials for update
using (temp_id is not null)
with check (
  client_id = (select client_id from spotify_credentials where id = id)
  and encrypted_client_secret = (select encrypted_client_secret from spotify_credentials where id = id)
  and temp_id = (select temp_id from spotify_credentials where id = id)
  and created_at = (select created_at from spotify_credentials where id = id)
);

-- Insert validation
create policy "Validated inserts"
on spotify_credentials for insert
with check (
  temp_id is not null 
  and client_id is not null 
  and encrypted_client_secret is not null 
  and length(temp_id) >= 7 
  and created_at <= current_timestamp 
  and (expires_at is null or expires_at > current_timestamp)
  and not exists (
    select 1 from spotify_credentials sc 
    where sc.temp_id = spotify_credentials.temp_id
  )
);
```

5. Generate encryption keys:
```bash
# Generate 32-byte key for AES-256
openssl rand -hex 32

# Generate 16-byte IV
openssl rand -hex 16
```

6. Update your `.env.local` with the required values:
```env
# Supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key

# Spotify
NEXT_PUBLIC_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
NEXT_PUBLIC_REDIRECT_URI=https://your.local.ip.address:port

# Encryption (from step 5)
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_32_byte_hex_key
ENCRYPTION_IV=your_16_byte_hex_key
```

Now, it's time to:

### Run the local dev server

Nocturne requires HTTPS to make API requests, so you need to set up HTTPS on the local server. This makes two different ways to run the dev server:

#### Using [Caddy][caddy-download]

[caddy-download]: https://caddyserver.com

This will use Caddy as a reverse proxy in front of Next.js's dev server.

On the last step where you start the development server, use `npx next dev` and then, in another tab/
window, `caddy run` to start. It will run on https://localhost:3443.

1. Install Caddy: this can be done with your OS package manager, or by downloading the executable from https://caddyserver.com/download.

2. Start the Next.js dev server:

```bash
npx next dev
```

3. In a different tab/window, start Caddy. This will run at https://localhost:3443.

```bash
caddy run
```

This may prompt you for a `sudo` password to install Caddy's certificate on your system, to make it automatically trusted.


#### Using `mkcert` and JS webserver

First, install `mkcert`.

```bash
# macOS
brew install mkcert

# Windows (using chocolatey)
choco install mkcert

# Linux
apt install mkcert
```

Trust the mkcert CA system-wide.

```bash
mkcert -install
```

Generate a certificate for localhost (and local IP addresses).

```bash
mkcert localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1 your.local.ip.address
```

Copy the certificate to the current dir.

```bash
# Rename the generated certificates
mv localhost+3.pem cert.crt
mv localhost+3-key.pem cert.key

# Copy CA certificates (locations vary by OS)
# macOS
cp "$(mkcert -CAROOT)/rootCA.pem" ca.crt
cp "$(mkcert -CAROOT)/rootCA-key.pem" ca.key

# Windows
copy "%LOCALAPPDATA%\mkcert\rootCA.pem" ca.crt
copy "%LOCALAPPDATA%\mkcert\rootCA-key.pem" ca.key

# Linux
cp "$(mkcert -CAROOT)/rootCA.pem" ca.crt
cp "$(mkcert -CAROOT)/rootCA-key.pem" ca.key
```

Create custom server file at `./server.js`:

```js
const { createServer } = require('https');
const { parse } = require('url');
const next = require('next');
const fs = require('fs');

const dev = process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production';
const app = next({ dev });
const handle = app.getRequestHandler();

const httpsOptions = {
  key: fs.readFileSync('./cert.key'),
  cert: fs.readFileSync('./cert.crt')
};

app.prepare().then(() => {
  createServer(httpsOptions, (req, res) => {
    const parsedUrl = parse(req.url, true);
    handle(req, res, parsedUrl);
  }).listen(3000, (err) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log('> Ready on https://localhost:3000');
    console.log('> Also available on https://your.local.ip.address:3000');
  });
});
```

Run the server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
bun dev
```

## Cloudflare Deployment Setup

1. Install Wrangler CLI:
```bash
npm install -g wrangler
```

2. Login to Cloudflare:
```bash
wrangler login
```

3. Create a KV namespace for encryption keys:
```bash
cd workers/key-rotation
npx wrangler kv:namespace create ENCRYPTION_KEYS
```

4. Update the KV namespace ID in your root `wrangler.toml`:
```toml
name = "nocturne"
compatibility_date = "2024-09-23"
compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]
pages_build_output_dir = ".vercel/output/static"

kv_namespaces = [
  { binding = "ENCRYPTION_KEYS", id = "your_namespace_id_here" }
]

[vars]
NEXT_PUBLIC_REDIRECT_URI = "your_production_url"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL = "your_supabase_url"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID = "your_client_id"
```

5. Set up environment secrets:
```bash
# For the main app
npx wrangler secret put SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
npx wrangler secret put SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET
npx wrangler secret put ENCRYPTION_KEY
npx wrangler secret put ENCRYPTION_IV

# For the key rotation worker
cd workers/key-rotation
npx wrangler secret put ENCRYPTION_KEY
npx wrangler secret put ENCRYPTION_IV
```

6. Deploy the key rotation worker:
```bash
cd workers/key-rotation
npx wrangler deploy
```

## Key Rotation

The project includes automatic key rotation for encrypted credentials. The rotation worker runs every 7 days and:
- Generates new encryption keys
- Re-encrypts existing credentials
- Maintains backups during rotation
- Handles failures gracefully

The rotation schedule can be modified in `workers/key-rotation/wrangler.toml`.

## Security
